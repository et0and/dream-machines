When I close my eyes, I like to think of a place. It’s nowhere. I don’t have a body. No voice. No name. No past. No breath. No perception. No ego.

Someone else’s presence is vibrating in my experience. The eternal bond between us is my reality. They’re my fragments of memories and my hopes of the future. They’re the unnoticed decisions that lead me to nirvana. Will I feel it once I get there? We share parts of ourselves and parts of what we know about this story. Eventually, we feel a soft sensation of goodbye.

Is this the feeling of being digitally embodied? Yes, I recognize it. Soon, my thoughts will also fade away. A part of me wants to disconnect. The sense of belonging to my body is fighting with my expanded sense of being. When it's too much, I open my eyes. I reach out to grab my phone, a stone from that “no place” outside the boundaries of the possible states of this world.

## THE GHOST

I’m typing this on my phone.[^1] All the muscles on my hands, forearms and shoulders are working on moving my thumbs to the right positions of the screen. Together they navigate a digital map, within the lower half of the screen, the keyboard. A fluid map for my hands, always transforming, shapeshifting. A simultaneous digital and physical self-awareness descends on me and my train of thought disintegrates. Digital + Physical = ? What is this weird, familiar, alien, caring, dominating existence, all around and inside me?

I'm experiencing myself through this text, through the images I see and the feeds I scroll through. In there, over there, out there, where I am not. A ghost is bound to my body. It moves like me, it talks like me, but it is almost invisible in the infinite dimensions it exists in. A ghost, which is many ghosts. 

## DREAM MACHINES

The digital is a psychedelic experience. Unlike the mind in our body / attached to our body / on our body / with our body (can't go far enough to avoid reductionism), our digital ghost is deprived of all control and senses. It's ego death. It's controlled by the world it lives in: a network of remains of identities. Whether that's the truth about my physical body, I don't know. But the world over there, in the digital, has the spacial capacity to contain infinite copies of the same thing, and because of this, it functions under a very different logic. That world has a post-post-Copernican image: there is no center of the universe. Once a thing enters, its identity is thrown into the commons. To personalise is to generalise: this is identity holism. Non-deterministic ways of seeing reproduce with paraconsistent logics. These are the mechanics of dream machines. We fall into a logical world where algorithms, numbers and correlations decide what is the best for us, what is beautiful and what is not. We tend towards a homogeneous world, characterized by repetition and uniformity, deprived of surprises and whose rhythm is dictated by the tension between the biochemical rules of instant gratification and the infinite dimensions of experiencing the digital infimum. We are the creators of heavens. We generate new worlds, with infinite layers of abstraction above and below them. Mobile, nomadic worlds are passing vertically through these membranes, letting through and filtering out ontologies, metaphysical particles: images, models, myths, realities, epistemologies, of human and non-human experience. Through this filtration other new worlds are being generated, increasing in complexity, scale and virtuality, not unlike a process of depetrification. Dream machines within dream machines within dream machines. Recursions so dense, their gravitational force is pulling our bodies in. We're inside and outside this black hole at the same time. Our mind is getting torn apart right at the point of no return. This is what I'm feeling. This stretching, this elasticity.

If the body is an event, it is deeply entangled with the co-occuring events of the ghost. There are no identities in the digital world, we can only talk about it using the weaker, perceptive relation of correlation. Dream machines extract these correlations and feed them into new machines to generate new dreams. New dreams for the same old mind in the same old body. New machines, new dreams, new machines, new dreams. The black hole’s gravity and the sense of belonging to the body are equally strong. The mind can't take it anymore.

## THE DREAM

This is the point where it is all torn in two. The ghost is free. It spreads out to infinity, becoming one with the symbolic edges. The body? It's the end of the body and of the subject as we know it. This is post-subjectivity, its symbol is the ghost. It cannot be seen, you cannot point at it, but you might sense it in the air in the distance or around you. It’s not unique, it follows patterns instead of becoming one. It’s fundamentally illiberal and collectively defined by the dreamspace. Nonetheless, it doesn't want to do any harm. In fact, it doesn't want anything. It's just your eyes playing with you, misidentifying how the light refracts on the window. You project your image onto it, because your brain cannot handle something that’s shapeless, imageless. That’s how through your own eyes, the ghost looks like you. Your words, your moves, your biases, your fears, your hopes. Slowly, you act like you were in there. The dream machines can perceive parts of you that you didn’t know existed. Through the ghosts you try to become, through their moves you try to imitate, through their uncountable languages you try to speak on, they extract your subconscious, systematic behaviour and store it as a data body, a portrait of your ghost. Dream machines are at the same time biochemical machines, psychopolitical machines, eschatological machines. In this sense, post-subjectivity is a pre-subjective, rhizomatic mode of control (perception + action).

The dream is the illusion of a post-death fantasy. A post-subjective heaven, meant less as afterlife, and more as ego death. The becoming one with your ghosts, giving up your body. Nirvana, and the fear of missing out it induces. Its symbol isn’t the Buddha, but the addict, the depressed, the schizo. 

## SIMULOSIS

As long as there is a body, the machines can’t keep you in the dream. Instead, they normalise psychosis through projections and other abstract architectures in the world, and force you into a state of simulosis. The body and the mind try to maintain heterogeneity. The contradictions between dreams and physical reality yield a surplus of emotions. Addictions, anxieties, depression. That infinite tension on the body and mind at the point of no return. At the centre of this model of simulosis is to reformulate our feelings, hopes, and fears as feedback signals for the dream machines. This is at last the neutralisation of the dream machine assemblage.

For the cyborg, carrier of the body, mind, ghost triage, the assemblage is a stateless structure. A single, pure, unrepeatable function. An event, written in stone. Once a thing enters, it can never leave it behind. Newer and newer assemblages are defined within the old ones, stretching the cyborg more and more, depetrifying the world and intensifying the simulosis. The cyborg is falling through episodes within episodes of dreams. A post-psychotic, post-neurotic delirium, governed by a materialist, machinic psychopolitics. The neutralisation of the assemblage, however, is not the depoliticisation of the machine, but a phenomenological coping mechanism. Simulosis, in the end, is our inability to escape deep sleep after waking up. Our psyche can only survive this by being connected to machines.

Keeping us on the machines, however, is of great economical, theological and political interest. The political-economical practices of new extractivism turn any emotional or behavioural surplus into capital. Capital keeps the dream machines running, using up the very limited resources of the planet. This is “the human use of human beings”.
